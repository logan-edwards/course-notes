This repo contains notes from every class I have taken since sophomore year. The original LaTeX is available with the PDFs.

The organizational structure is (will be) as follows:

**engineering-notes**: contains notes from my courses in the Mechanical Engineering department at the University of Michigan.
**math-notes**: contains notes from an assortment of upper-level math classes I took in fulfillment of a Mathematics minor at the University of Michigan.
**random-notes**: contains notes from self-study, certification programs, and other random stuff not taken at university.
